# Walmart Customer Segregation ML

## Business Problem:

Walmart Technology has been tasked with identifying two groups of people for marketing purposes: People who earn an income of less than $50,000 and those who earn more than $50,000. To assist in this pursuit, Walmart has developed a means of accessing 40 different demographic and employment-related variables for any person they are interested in marketing to. Additionally, Walmart has been able to compile a dataset that provides gold labels for a variety of observations of these 40 variables within the population. Using the dataset given, train and validate a classifier that predicts this outcome.

Walmart is also interested in developing a rudimentary segmentation model of the people represented in this dataset in the context of marketing. Using one or more of your favorite machine learning or data science techniques, create such a segmentation model and demonstrate how the resulting groups differ from one another.
